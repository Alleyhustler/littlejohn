                    <p>let's redesign the new one square meter apartment in new york little john spent 10 years working hard as a brick layer and finally saved enough money to buy his own house however when he saw it he was so shocked that he fell to the ground because the total combined length and width of the house was less than 2 square meters making it extremely small even too small to comfortably raise a kitten now he used all his ingenuity to redesign the space he creatively added space by securing a borrowed square meter to one wall he constructed a circular frame from galvanized square steel reinforcing it with horizontal and vertical welves below he used pillars for support screwing them tightly to the wall he then covered it with a layer of eco-friendly solid wood board making it strong and durable on top he placed a soft foldable mattress that doubles as a bed spacious enough for him and his girlfriend</p>

                    <p>let's transform a zero square meter space into a functional house little john worked diligently for 10 years saving a million dollars to buy his own house however the space he could afford was only 0.01 square meters so tiny that not even his pet could live there the only option left was to summon his eagle but since john has a fear of heights he found himself crying every night so he decides to reinstall it like this first use galvanized square steel to create a frame that extends outside he can borrow some screws from his aunt to securely fix it to the wall covering the frame with wood veneer will make it both beautiful and neat change the entrance door to open outward and use the door opening to install a flip-up door cabinet perfect for storing his underwear and smelly socks install large broken bridge aluminum windows for panoramic views construct a bed cabinet beneath the window to store thick quilts infrequently worn clothing and luggage lay down a soft mattress on the bed cabinet making it a cozy sleeping space for both little john and his girlfriend surround the area with romantic soft</p>

                    <p>little john lives in an extremely tiny room in shanghai so small that it's hard to turn around without bumping into something it feels more like a coffin than a room even though he makes a good amount of money selling vegetables it's still not enough to afford a bigger place frustrated and upset little john sits and cries every day so he decided to redesign it like this first little john removed the windows on both sides and used square steel to create a frame asking his aunt to lend him some money from her pension to buy expansion screws to secure it firmly to the wall he then covered it with eco-friendly wood veneers wrapping the surrounding walls and ceiling with the same wooden boards afterwards he installed an aluminum alloy window seal to ensure everything was tightly sealed next he built a set of low cabinets by the window on the left side of the cabinets he set up an induction cooker to serve as the cooking area and on the right he placed a dishwashing area with a wash basin that doubles as a laundry area above the cabinets he stored all </p>
